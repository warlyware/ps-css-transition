                                    Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
                                    All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
                                    Just relax and let it flow. That easy. These trees are so much fun.
                                    I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
                                    The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy.
